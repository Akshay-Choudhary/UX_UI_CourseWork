As a part of mid-term project we have decided to work on ‘Wikipedia’. Document provides project overview which includes scope, problem statement and information regarding role of each team members who are working on this project. We are going to work on scope, various planes such as strategy, scope and structure, information architecture and wireframes of changes that can be done to improve user experience of a website.

Problem Statement
In spite of being on a global rank of 6 as per http://www.alexa.com/ analytics, it still lacks on a major part of user experience. So we have come up with an idea of improving the front-end design of major modules of the website.
  
  1. Look and feel:
      i. The first impression that any particular user could get about the website is that it seems too old or obsolete considering the       poor color scheme Wikipedia has adopted.
      ii. Header and Footer: Accustomed to the various websites that a user goes through every day the header part of Wikipedia is not         organized as a user would not find the custom links that would navigate to different pages along with it the footer part is not          aligned properly.
  2. Homepage:
      i. Structure of content on the homepage is not organized properly.
      ii. There is no consistency in information displayed on the main page since the content changes when the language is changed.
  3. Navigation Bar:
     Since the navigation bar is aligned vertically, it is occupying a lot of space on the page. A beginner will get confused with a lot      of links available for navigation and has to scroll often to find a particular link.
  4. Wiki Search Result :
      i. When a user searches for a given topic on Wikipedia the result displays a content section which includes different points that          occupies a lot of space above the actual information that a user wants about the searched topic.
     ii. Apart from the content index the actual information that is displayed needs to be organized in a collapsible bar so that the            user can click on any of the bar and the particular result would be displayed instead of scrolling down to find the required            information.
    iii. As we know pictures can convey more information then text which is not the case with Wikipedia search result where there are            hardly any images for the user to grasp information quickly.
  5. Create Account:
     Account creation requires username and password but email is optional so a user can create multiple accounts and alter the              information.
